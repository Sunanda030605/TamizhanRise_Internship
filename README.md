# Sales Forecasting using Linear Regression

A simple yet effective machine learning project that forecasts future sales based on historical online sales data using Python and presents the results visually using Power BI.

## Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to estimate future sales based on past performance. This project aims to help solve that by using a regression-based forecasting approach.

## Objective

Build a linear regression model using Python to predict future sales and display the insights through visualizations and interactive dashboards in Power BI.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI for interactive dashboard
- Git/GitHub for version control
- CSV for dataset storage

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Linear Regression modeling  
- Daily sales aggregation and forecasting for the next 60 days  
- Visualization of actual vs predicted revenue  
- Exported forecast data for integration with Power BI  
- Power BI dashboard with:  
  - ðŸ“ˆ Line charts of trends  
  - ðŸ“Š KPIs such as Mean Squared Error, RÂ² Score  
  - ðŸ“‹ Tabular view of future predictions
